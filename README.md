# Projects found in Kaggle that I think are cool

The first project I'm looking into is to due with pricing in an e-commerce website. The goal is to desing
a model capable of comparing and categorizing prices across different brands and product segments. More info:

In other words, this repository is for you hands-on-learners!

I use macOS, and that is what I developed this course on.  Everything _ought_ to work similarly on
major Linux distributions and Windows. Please [contact me]() ASAP
if you have trouble with anything on this page.


## Install Rust

Rust is required for this course!  The latest stable version is always recommended.

- Go to [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org) and click on the `Get Started`
   button and follow the instructions to install Rust for your operating system.
   - Please DO NOT install rust via some other package manager.  It will probably be a version that is _really old_.

You should get somewhat similar output if you run commands like the ones below (newer versions are okay).  If you 
already have an old version of Rust installed, then run `rustup update` to install a newer version.

```shell
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.54.0 (5ae8d74b3 2021-06-22)
```
